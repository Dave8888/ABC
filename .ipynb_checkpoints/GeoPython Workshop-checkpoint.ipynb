    "Welcome to the GeoPython Workshop!\n",
    "\n",
    "The GeoPython workshop aims to introduce Python programming as a means of manipulating geospatial data. The workshop will include exercises and problems where you will analyze and manipulate geospatial data. This workshop is for beginners to the Python programming language and geospatial data.\n",

    "*Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is authored by Guido Van Rossum a Dutch programmer. He is known as the Benevolent Dictator for Life. He was employed at Google for 7 years and currently works at Dropbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is currently being used in a wide variety of applications and domains. \n",

Most vector data are useful for storing data that has discrete boundaries such land parcels, roads, buildings, points of interest and many others. Raster datasets are generally represented by rectangular grid of pixels. Raster data is focused on modelling continuous phenomena and images of the earth. Generally raster data are your satellite images, digital elevation models, dsm, and others.\n",
