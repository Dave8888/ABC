    "## Python Backgrounder\n",
    "*Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is authored by Guido Van Rossum a Dutch programmer. He is known as the Benevolent Dictator for Life. He was employed at Google for 7 years and currently works at Dropbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is currently being used in a wide variety of applications and domains. \n",
